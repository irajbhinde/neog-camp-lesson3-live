            Here I am, at the last stage of levelZero & wondering what topic should I cover for my mark15 assignment. After pondering a little, I decided why not talk about my Journey with Coding so far. It’s been a hell of a bumpy ride & if you’ve ever felt the same, you know what am talking about.

            I was introduced to programming during my engineering & we had java in the first year. During those days I had written more codes in my notebook than in the computer lab. Not blaming the system but all I was doing was ratofy ( mugging up ) the code. Being an electronics student I had little to no touch with programming after that. During my final year, I took up java & python courses to get a job in college placements. Here’s when I started learning programming concepts, but never really got into the grove, I was irregular &  got slowly inactive hence developing this coding fear.

        <p class="blog-padding">
            But here’s a thing about me, I never give up! I know that the fear which I have is actually not a fear, it is just because of my lack of discipline & irregularities in practicing.

        In September 2021, I decided to start pursuing NeoG LevelZero. And Trust me when I say this, Learning Programming has been fun, right from the first lecture!! I’ve enjoyed completing all the mark assignments. The way Tanay Sir has approached NeoG is really simple & fun. Not once have I felt overwhelming watching the videos except for mark13 but I just rewatched the video & was good to go!! So yeah, If anyone has come across this blog & hasn’t checked NeoG yet, do give it a chance. And if you ever get any kinds of doubt, the <a href="https://bit.ly/tanaydiscord"> #TeamTanay </a> community on discord is always there to help. 
        </p>
        <p class="blog-padding">
            That’s all for this blog, I am really looking forward to levelOne interviews & a chance to further find my interests.
